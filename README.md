# Card model
## 1. EMV Chip
EMV stands for Europay, Mastercard and Visa, as these are the three companies that began the chip initiative.
The chip safely stores your account information and helps to provide better protection against fraud by initialising the chip and pin payment method.

## 2. Banking Logo
The issuing bank, building society, alternative baking solution or prepaid card company will generally place their logo somewhere on the front of their debit cards.

## 3. Contactless Payment Symbol
The `Contactless` payment symbol means that the card is contactless-enabled.
All Suits Me debit cards are contactless-enabled, meaning you don't need to use you Chip and PIN for purchases up to a target ammount of money. Contactless payments can be anywhere you see the contactless payment logo. To use the contactless payments feature on your card, simply hold your card over the card payment reader.

## 4. Payment Network Logo
The `Payment Network` logo tells you what type of card you have, with the most common being Visa and Mastercard. You can use your debit card to make a payment anywhere where you can see this logo.

## 5. Card Holder Name
This is the name of the person that the debit card belongs to.
This isn’t always the name of the account holder. For example, if you have Suits Me account, you can also authorise someone to have a debit card in their own name that’s linked to your account.

## 6. Expiry Date
The `Expiry Date`, often labelled as `Expires End` is the date at when your card expires.
When your Suits Me card is due to expire, you will receive a new one free of charge before the expiry date. If the card is due to expire at the end of a month, your new card will be issued at the beginning of that month. If the card is due to expire at the beginning of the month, a new card will be issued to you the month before the expiry date.

## 7. Account Number
An `Account Number` is an eight-digit number that is linked to your account.
An account number is required when transferring money into an account, including your wages. To have your wages paid into your account, you’ll need to provide your employer with your account number and sort code.

## 8. Signature Strip
The signature strip is for you to add your signature to prior to using the debit card.
This is a security feature as some payments may require you to sign upon making a payment. In this case, the merchant will compare the signature on the strip to the signature you use upon payment to verify that they match. The majority of merchants won’t accept a debit card as a payment method that hasn’t been signed.

## 9. Magnetic Strip
The black colour strip contains secure information about you, your account and card. Only card readers can gather and read the information safely stored within the magnetic strips.

## 10. Card Number
One of the most important parts of a debit card and often referred to as `the long card number` (and also known as a Permanent Account Number or PAN), the card number consists of 16 digits in sections of four, for example, `1234  5678  9876  5432` and is required when making a purchase over the phone or online.

## 11. Sort Code
A `Sort Code` is a six-digit number that identifies your bank, building society or alternative banking solution. The number is usually split up into pairs, for example; `12-34-56` and is linked to your account.
A sort code is required when transferring money into an account, including your wages. To have your wages paid into your account, you’ll need to provide your employer with your sort code and account number.

## 12. Contact Details
On cards, these are our contact details so you always have them to hand when needed. However, we do recommend you store our contact numbers safely in your phone in case your card becomes lost or stolen. Our contact details can be found in many other easy to access places including the Contact Us page on our website, within the mobile banking app and your online banking account.

## 13. CVV/CVC 3-Digit Code
Also known as the `security code`, `CV2` or `last three digits on the back of the card`, this code is unique to you and your debit card. These three digits ensure that your card is legitimate and is required when making a payment online or over the phone.

## 14. Hologram
A hologram on a card is a small, silver-coloured mirror-like section with a 3D image. This is another security feature of bank cards (including debit cards, credit cards and prepaid cards) and allows merchants to spot the difference between a real bank card and a fake bank card.
